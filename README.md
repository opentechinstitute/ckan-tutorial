# ckan-tutorial
A set of files to help people start using our ckan instance

This is growing documentation to help bootstrap developing projects using ckan as a back end for interactive data viz.

The idea is that you clone this repo, and open the tutorial in your browser; then by editing values in the javascript or html, you can get a sense for interacting with the ckan api. Reach out to @natmey if you have questions.
